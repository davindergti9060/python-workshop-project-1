1: Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and computes area
INPUT:
#improting math to solve math.. programs
>>> import math

# Get the radius of the circle as input from the user.
>>> radius = float( input("Enter radius of the circle: ") )

# To compute the area of the circle.
>>> area = math.pi * radius ** 2

# For printing output ( area of the circle) .
>>> print("The area of the circle is", area, "square units.")

OUTPUT:
Enter radius of the circle: 1.1
The area of the circle is 3.8013271108436504 square units.
# Input the radius of the circle : 1.1 The area of the circle with radius 1.1 is: 3.8013271108436504




2:  Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.
INPUT:
""" OS is an built-in module with methods for interacting with the operating system, 
like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc."""
>>> import os

"""This function takes a filename as input and returns the extension of the file,
(filename: it is the filename to get the extension of)
(Returns: The extension of the file)"""
>>> def get_extension(filename):
>>>     return os.path.splitext(filename) [1]

# accepting file name as input from user
>>> filename = input("Enter the filename: ")

# getting extension of file name 
>>> extension = get_extension(filename)

#printing the extension of the filename (Output).
>>> print("Extension of the file is:", extension)


OUTPUT:
# trial 1 with .py extension :
Enter the filename: try1.py
Extension of the file is: .py

# Trial 2 with .html extension :
Enter the filename: try2.html
Extension of the file is: .html

# Trial 3 with no extension in filename :
Enter the filename: try-nothing
Extension of the file is:

# Exception : if [1] is not added at last of return function (line 3) it gives output like :
Enter the filename: try.css
Extension of the file is: ('try', '.css')
